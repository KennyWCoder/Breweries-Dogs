# BrewDogs

# Description

The purpose of the website is to help locate local breweries in a fun way. When you open the website, you will be greeted with a cute friend that will take you to the search area. When you get there just insert the city and state of where you'd like to search for breweries and you will be presented with 5 as well as a cute furry friend to serve as a conversation starter. Take your friends or make new friends :)

This application was created with HTML, CSS, Materialize CSS framework, and JavaScript.
